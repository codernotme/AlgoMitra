              Searching is the process of finding the location of a specific
              item in a collection of items. In computer science, searching
              algorithms are essential for retrieving information efficiently.

              In this visualizer, you can explore various searching algorithms,
              each with its unique method of finding elements in data. From
              basic ones like Linear Search to advanced methods like A* and
              Best-First Search, youâ€™ll see how each works and what makes them
              effective.
